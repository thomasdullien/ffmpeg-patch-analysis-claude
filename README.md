# FFMpeg crash analyzer Claude Code Scaffolding

This repository contains some experimental prompting to equip Claude Code
with the tooling and some subagents to analyze and debug security-relevant
crashes obtained from the FFMpeg bug tracker.

You'll need to install your own FFMpeg source code copy in the FFmpeg
directory.
